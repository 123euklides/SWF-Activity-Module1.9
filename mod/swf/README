PLEASE NOTE: THIS MAY NOT BE THE LATEST VERSION OF THE MODULE. PLEASE FIND THE LATEST VERSION AT:
http://code.google.com/p/swf-activity-module/downloads/list

The SWF Activity Module is the most flexible, functional, robust and powerful way to deploy Flash animations and applications in Moodle 1.9. It supports any version of Flash and Actionscript.

    Upload the /swf/ directory and all its contents to ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/
    Make sure that the directory structure isn't ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/swf/swf/... It should be ***YOUR MOODLE***/mod/swf/...
    In Moodle, login as an administrator
    Go to Site Administration > Notifications
    The SWF Activity Module will install/update itself
    If any settings have been changed, you'll be asked to save the settings on the Site Administration > Modules > Activities > SWF page
    That's it!

How to install the AMFPHP Moodle interface

Download from: http://code.google.com/p/swf-activity-module/downloads/list

The AMFPHP service library allows Flash applications to communicate with Moodle's APIs and services, for example, to push grades into Moodle's grade book, to use Moodle's built in chat and private messaging, and save images and webcam snapshots to the moodledata directories.

    Upload the /amfphp/ directory and all its contents to ***YOUR MOODLE***/lib/
    Make sure that the directory structure isn't ***YOUR MOODLE***/lib/amfphp/amfphp/... It should be ***YOUR MOODLE***/lib/amfphp/...
    That's it! It doesn't need to install or modify anything.
